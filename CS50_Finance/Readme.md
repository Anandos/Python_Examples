## Finance
Using Python, Flask with Jinja, SQLite 3 and an API from IEX.\
I coded all the functions in app.py except 'login' and logout'.\
Goal was to create a website that could register a user with a hashed version of their password.\
To buy, sell, and quote stock prices live from IEX.\
And to display the user's portfolio and transaction history.
